<h2>
<span style="font-family: Times;">Course Description<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<big>This course provides a broad introduction to
machine learning and statistical pattern recognition.  Topics include:
supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning,
parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector
machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction,
kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs; VC theory;
large margins); reinforcement learning and adaptive control.
The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning,
such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation,
bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data
processing. </big></p>

<br>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times;">Homeworks and Grading</span></h2>

<big>
There will be four written <b>homeworks</b>, one <b>midterm,</b>
and a major open-ended <b>term project</b>. The assignments will contain written questions and
questions that require some Matlab programming.  In the term project,
you will investigate some interesting aspect of machine learning or
apply machine learning to a problem that interests you. </p>

We try very hard to make questions unambiguous, but some ambiguities
may remain. Ask if confused or state your assumptions explicitly. Reasonable
assumptions will be accepted in case of ambiguous questions.</p>

<!--After you get back a graded homework, you may also be able to regain up to 1/4 
of lost points on the homework by submitting a corrected version of a solution. 
(Because of scheduling and registrar constraints, this will apply only to homeworks 1-3.) 
The corrected solution to homework N should be stapled on top of homework N 
and submitted together with homework N+1. Write clearly which questions 
you are correcting. Do NOT staple the homeworks N and N+1 together or else it 
will not be graded. More details about this will be provided in later handouts.</p--> 

<p><b>Course grades:</b> 
will be based 40% on homeworks (10% each),
20% on the midterm and 40% on the major term project. 
<!--Up to 2% extra
credit may be awarded for class participation, such as for helping
classmates on the 
<a href="http://piazza.com/stanford/fall2014/cs229">Piazza forum</a>.
--></p>
<p>
<b>Honor code:</b> 
We strongly encourage students to form
study groups.  Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups.
However, each student must write down the solutions independently, and without
referring to written notes from the joint session.  In other words, each
student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct
it by him/herself. In addition, each student should write on the problem
set the set of people with whom s/he collaborated. </p>

Further, since we occasionally reuse problem set questions from
previous years, we expect students not to copy, refer to, or look
at the solutions in preparing their answers.  It is an <b>honor code
violation to intentionally refer to a previous year's solutions</b>.
This applies both to the official solutions and to solutions that
you or someone else may have written up in a previous year.
</p>

<p>
<b>Late assignments:</b> 
Each student will have a total of <b>seven
free late (calendar) days</b> to use for
homeworks, project proposals and project milestones.

Once these late days are exhausted, any assignments turned in late will be
penalized 20% per late day.  However, <b>no assignment will be accepted
more than three days after its due date</b>, and late days cannot be used
for the final project poster or writeup.  Each 24 hours or part thereof that a
homework is late uses up one full late day.
</p>

<p>
<b>Assignment submission:</b> 
<!--To hand in an assignment, write down the date and time of submission, and leave 
it in the submission box near/outside Gates 188 and 182. Please don't disturb 
the staff in those offices; directions to the hand-in box are 
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/submissionbox/tour.html">here</a>. 
It is an honor code violation to write down the wrong time.</p>
Regular (non-SCPD) students should submit hardcopies of all four written 
homeworks. Please do not email your homework solutions to us. </p>

<p>
<b>SCPD students:</b> Please follow these updated procedures to ensure your homework be properly collected, graded and returned.
<br>
<ul>
<li>If you are submitting your homework on-time without using any late-days, please submit your homework through the SCPD office.

<!--SCPD students: Please submit your assignments at https://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/cgi-bin/submit.php as a single PDF file under 20MB in size. If you have trouble submitting online, you can also email your submission to cs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu. However, we strongly recommend using the website submission method as it will provide confirmation of submission, and also allow us to track and return your graded homework to you more easily. If you are scanning your document by cellphone, please check the Piazza forum for recommended cellphone scanning apps and best practicesi.--> 
We will be using Gradescope to handle assignment submissions. Entry code for Gradescope is <b>9GK339</b>. 
Hard copy and email submissions will not be accepted. 

<ul>
<li>
Assignment 0 is a dummy assignment that will allow you to get used to the Gradescope submission process, and it is due on <b>10/05</b> at <b>11:00 AM</b>. It is worth 0 points. 
<br> 
<li>
When you submit your assignment, make sure to tag all the pages for each problem according to Gradescope's submission directions. Graders may deduct points on problems that are difficult to find. 
 
<br> 
<li>
The due dates on Gradescope will be the hard deadlines, after which we will not accept submissions. On-time submissions should be made before the deadlines listed on the website. Do not confuse the hard deadline on Gradescope with the deadlines on the website. 
 
<br> 
<li>
We strongly encourage typesetting your assignments. If the grader cannot read your assignment for whatever reason (handwriting, photo/scanning quality, etc.), you will not receive credit for that work.
 
</br> 
<li>
Regrades will also be handled through Gradescope. We will begin to accept regrades for an assignment the day after grades are released for a window of three days. We will not accept regrades for an assignment outside of that window. Regrades are intended to remedy grading errors, so regrade requests must discuss why you believe your answer is correct in light of the deduction you received. We do not accept regrade requests of the form "I deserve more points for this" or "that deduction is too harsh." If you submit a regrade request of this form, you will receive further deductions. When you submit a regrade request, the grader may review your entire assignment, in which case you may lose points on other questions. Your score on an assignment may decrease if you submit for a regrade.

The term project may be done in teams of up to three persons.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Midterm Information</b>: The midterm is <b>open-book/open-notes/open labtop (no internet)</b>. It will take place on <b>Wednesday, November 9, 2016</b> from <b>6-9 PM</b>. The exam venue will be announced soon. 
<br>
<b>Syllabus:</b> Everything up to and including lecture on  <b>Wednesday, November 2nd</b>. All the relevant lecture notes (until, but not including unsupervised learning) are included, including the relevant supplemental notes. 
<br> 
Also, there are two sets of notes dealing with SVMs (from the lecture notes and the supplemental notes) on the website. Primarily, this class has dealt with material from the supplemental notes on SVMs. So, we will not include material on Lagrange duality, KKT conditions, etc. from the lecture notes on SVMs in the midterm.

</p>



<h2><span style="font-family: Times;">Sections<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

To review material from the prerequisites or to supplement the lecture
material, there will occasionally be extra discussion sections held on
Friday.  An announcement will be made whenever one of these sections is
held. Attendance at these sections is optional.
</p>

<h2><span style="font-family: Times;">Communication with the Teaching Staff<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

you will get answers much more quickly.  Of course, confidential or personal questions
can still be sent directly to Prof. Ng, Prof. Duchi or the TAs. 

<!--<p><b> Grading Questions and Regrade Requests : </b> For grading questions, please talk 
to us after class. If you want a regrade, write an explanation and bring your homework 
to one of the regrade office hours, dedicated specially to regrade requests.-->
